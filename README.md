## Sorting and Visualizing MessagesFeed Source 

The feed pro-grammatically and categories the messages according to the sentiment (field: sentiment) of the message (field: Message).

The messages should be displayed on a map and attached to the respective cities mentioned in the message bonus: Extra marks will be given for prowess and effort in visualization.

How can the different sentiment categories be visualized on a map and how can time be factored in the visualization ? 

- every category shown with different pin marker (emoji)
- pin size differ according to time (we assume time by being the order of objects in the JSON)
